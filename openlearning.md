As a PhD candidate, on the way of just solving a small bug in the code or trying to come up with an entirely new algorithm, I've been autonomous learning and studying everyday. I will try to give a record of whatever I read/saw and can recommend on specific topics. I found it extremely helpful for myself for later lookup and I hope that it may help anyone interested. Most stuff will be about point cloud/video/image procesing, machine learning/deep learning, as my job is related to these topics. Besides, I might add also some posts related to my daily lifes.
