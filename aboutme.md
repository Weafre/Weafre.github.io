I am doing a PhD at the [Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing](https://www.lms.tf.fau.eu/) of University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU), Germany since May 2021. My research focuses on Deep Learning based multimedia compression and representation, specialize in Point Cloud data. Previously I worked as a research engineer in the same topic at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), France for 8 months.  I received my Master's degree in Multimedia Networking from Télécom ParisTech, Université Paris-Saclay in 2020. 
**News**
* June 2022 - I'll be presenting my first work as a PhD entiled "Learning-based Lossless Point Cloud Geometry Coding using Sparse Tensors" at the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2022), 16-19 October 2022 Bordeaux, France.
* May 2022 - A manuscript submitted at IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology - one of the top journals in image/video/high-diemnsional data processing.
* Feb 2022 - I recently accepted an internship offer at Meta Reality Labs (Facebook) which starts in December 2022. I'll be working on Point Clouds, Mesh Compression for immersive applications (VR, AR, ...).
