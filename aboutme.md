I am doing a PhD at the [Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing](https://www.lms.tf.fau.eu/) of University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU), Germany since May 2021. My research focuses on Deep Learning based multimedia compression and representation, specialize in Point Cloud data. Previously I worked as a research engineer in the same topic at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), France for 8 months.  I received my Master's degree in Multimedia Networking from Télécom ParisTech, Université Paris-Saclay in 2020.
