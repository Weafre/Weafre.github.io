I am doing a PhD at the [Chair of Multimedia Communications and Signal Processing](https://www.lms.tf.fau.eu/) of University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU), Germany since May 2021. My research focuses on Deep Learning based multimedia compression and representation, specialize in Point Cloud data. Previously I worked as a research engineer in the same topic at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/), France for 8 months.  I received my Master's degree in Multimedia Networking from Télécom ParisTech, Université Paris-Saclay in 2020. 

**Research Interests:** Point Cloud compression, Point Cloud processing (segmentation, classification, completion,...),  Image/video processing, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, 


**News:**
* **December 2022** - I'll be joining Meta Reality Labs in Redmond, USA as n Research Scientist Intern starting in January 2023. 
* **December 2022** - Good News! Our work on joint point cloud geometry and attribute compression has been accepted to the IEEE T-CSVT journal. The paper went through 2 rounds of peer review which took approximately 7 months. 
* **November 2022** - I have a submission at the IEEE ICASSP 2023 which will take place in the Greek island of Rhodes from June 04 to June 09, 2023.
* **November 2022** - EmpkinS' winter school takes place in the beautiful city - Hintertux, Austria.
* **October 2022** - I am attending and presenting our work at the IEEE ICIP 2022 in Bordeaux, France.
* **June 2022** - I'll be presenting my first work as a PhD entitled "Learning-based Lossless Point Cloud Geometry Coding using Sparse Tensors" at the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2022), 16-19 October 2022 Bordeaux, France.
* **May 2022** - A manuscript submitted at IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology - one of the top journals in image/video/high-diemnsional data processing.
* **Feb 2022** - I recently accepted an internship offer at Meta Reality Labs (Facebook) which starts in December 2022. I'll be working on Point Clouds, Mesh Compression for immersive applications (VR, AR, ...).
